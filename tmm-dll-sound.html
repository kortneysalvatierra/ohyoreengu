Hello, all! My computer decided to randomly shut down the other day while I was playing Fallout 4. I turned it back on and everything seemed normal, but when I booted up Chrome, the computer died again. Both times the code it posted was that it had detected a power surge, and shut off. The computer then had difficulty turning back on again, or powering all the devices. This loop continued until I shut it down completely, figuring it to be a PSU problem.

My boss saw the size of the recent build of one of our apps. It was some 4-odd megabytes. Loads everything needed in ~3 seconds (1 one of the database calls it makes needs updated hehe).

Hello, as you could see, I am having trouble maintaining 144+ fps. I have capped it at 146 fps and at matche all around it's fine and very rarely drops to 130, other times it feels like having 125 average fps by constantly dropping from 146 to about 100-120. My thoughts are that CPU is bottlenecking, but it never reaches 100%, fps starts to drop to 125 from 146 at about 90-95% CPU usage. I use MSI Afterburner to keep an eye on the temperatures and CPU's stays at 60-67 Celsius. Meanwhile Ключевые возможности программы.

Hello, I have been working on a framework to help write DLL plugins for games. Currently only 64 bit but 32 bit support is planned in the future. The framework itself is not game-specific so one could also use it to develop for other games such as Fallout 4 or completely different ones that aren't Bethesda games but you will need to write a type library (game library) if you want to use game-specific types, events and such. It is still very early stages but far enough Pisses me off.

A few months ago I realized that half of my 16gb ram was not visible in the system. It has worked flawlessly before, I don't know what caused it to break. I decided to do a clean install of Windows 7 (64 bit) to try and fix it. Didn't work, and now my second GPU isn't detected either. Both GPU's spin up when i boot, but only one is detected. The RAM ( are two sets of 2x4gb sticks. Yes, they are not the same modes, but they worked So, I'm currently playing through the Far Harbor DLC in Fallout 4. It rains a lot there and whenever it starts to rain, the sound drops out. I've been playing fairly well with the pulse latency setting, but the Far Harbor DLC absolutely kills it! I can load up the game and I have about 10 seconds before the sound completely disappears.

I tried to download TF2 It finished and started working but when I got into a game it was so choppy I couldn't play it. at the spawn area in Dustbowl I had around 8 FPS. I was confident that my PC would be able to run TF2 and much more without any trouble. I installed Counter Strike Source and it was better but still sort of choppy. I checked and I was getting around 25-45 FPS depending on what was going 
Tried different ways of importing (create empty, drag & drop etc), no difference. A tone will start playing and then never stop, eventually breaking Fl Studio if trying to keep working on the project.  This happens to all sf2 files, so it's the file format or something that gives Fl Studio the hiccups. Sometimes it works fine though, it appears to be random. Any idea what the cause might. I use my computer to play games pretty much all day. I am sadly, a complete scrub when it comes to knowledge about pc hardware. The only thing I know I want specifically is an SSD of some sort. I'm posting my DxDiag info on here (I made a reddit specifically for this :3) and I can't find where it says my motherboard is anywhere. I was thinking about getting an i7, but was told I need to know motherboard compatability. I have 0 to spend and I want to make as much progress towards improving. Hello!
