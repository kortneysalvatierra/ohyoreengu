There's been a lot of confusion surrounding supers (especially Spectral Blades) and their exact stats, so I've compiled a list and provided my own analysis. Super Damage Resistance All super damage resistances tested with no masterwork (old y1 armor), used melee, but tested with other weapons to ensure % is correct. All numbers have a margin of error of \~1% because damage and health is in decimals, but can't be seen in game. Super % Damage Resistance –°–∫–∞—á–∞—Ç—å –ø–æ—Ä–Ω–æ —á–µ—Ä–µ–∑ —Ç–æ—Ä—Ä–µ–Ω—Ç - –ë–µ–ª—ã–µ –Ω–æ—á–∏ –°–∞–Ω–∫—Ç-–ü–µ—Ç–µ—Ä–±—É—Ä–≥–∞ , –∏–∑ –∫–∞—Ç–µ–≥–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –†—É—Å—Å–∫–æ–µ –ø–æ—Ä–Ω–æ. So one of my bigger passions in this game, is to theorycraft fun builds to try out and play, over time I have amounted quite a few that I think worked great, and a few that I'm still toying with since Forgotten Gods released. I have been lurking in this sub for a long time now and wanted to give back a little, for anyone looking for ideas or with a passion of making cool ass builds to kill lots of monsters. None of my builds are perfect –°–∫–∞—á–∞—Ç—å –ø–æ—Ä–Ω–æ —á–µ—Ä–µ–∑ —Ç–æ—Ä—Ä–µ–Ω—Ç - –ú–æ–ª–æ–¥—ã–µ —à–∫–æ–ª—å–Ω–∏—Ü—ã: –ü–ª–æ—Ö–æ–µ –ø–æ–≤–µ–¥–µ–Ω–∏–µ , –∏–∑ –∫–∞—Ç–µ–≥–æ—Ä–∏–∏ –ü–æ—Ä–Ω–æ —Ñ–∏–ª—å–º—ã. This might have been the craziest free agency of all time. OBJ wasn't going to cleveland, but then he did. AB to Buffalo for a few hours, then gets sent to the Raiders. Barr pulling a DJ. Bell to the Jets. ET3 to the Ravens. And thats not even factoring the draft Rumors. For this special edition of the Mock Draft, we are gonna say that the Cardinals Murray rumors are actually true. These trades and picks are all my opinions and speculation, so it may be off on what your franchise actually needs.

I have a few thoughts I wanted to get down on some of the general moves we've seen from the FO over the last few months. This isn't necessarily meant to be a defense of those moves, so much as an explanation for them. Personally I roll my eyes when I hear someone instantly pans a trade because the 'GM's an idiot'. Anyone who has spent a career in baseball and has access to entire scouting/analytics teams aren't making dumb mistakes without understanding a player's basic boxcar stats.

I feel much more passionately about the Finn nerf than I have about nerfs in the past. Yes, the Enfys nerf hurt at first, but after I modded her for pure tenacity, she did just fine against Revan. This one, on the other hand, cuts a lot deeper. Finn was my 2nd zeta after Boba Fett way back in the day. After his initial rework where he got his zeta, I saw how awesome his team was on offense - holding their own against most other meta teams at the time, especially GK/Zarriss. This was also before. With the 2018 season officially over, it's time to look forward. Something I'm sure all of us have been doing since December. Thankfully, we have some of the best minds in the business running our team. Here's what I think they'll do this March to put the Vikings in the right place for 2019.

Hello RL, I‚Äôm so happy to be writing this review. This was my most expensive rep haul to date and although the items were small in size it was pretty expensive for items that could potentially get seized by customs! I decided to do this review in two parts this will be for my bracelets and part 2 will be a few vca single Alhambra necklaces, one is the diamond version which is just gorgeous. Hopefully you‚Äôre somewhere comfy with a nice glass of wineüç∑ (a California cab is my personal favorite). What Making A Murderer Part 2 shows us is how an investigation evolves with new information, new witnesses, and old information surfacing that may have been kept in a desk for 12 years. With an evolving investigation sometimes comes evolving suspects and theories. For Zellner, her strategy to work "inside-out" from Teresa's inner circle and "clear" potential suspects first led her to Ryan Hillegas (http://www.stevenaverycase.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Motion-for-Post-Conviction-. This is a longer one but I wanted to re-direct some of my frustration with the murray conversation to something that I have been thinking about for a while. Keep in mind that I like Kiem and Mr. Bidwill. Starting off with the before the 2018 season. We went into the 2017 season thinking that our team was going to dominate with all of our pieces coming back, BA in full stride after the health scare, and Carson Palmers presumably last stand.

You read the title and were slightly intrigued, which is why you're here. If you visited this post because you recognized the name "Pokemon Brick Bronze" then you are a person worthy of my respect. If not, this will all be completely new to you. 'Pokemon Brick Bronze Demo' is, as the title implies, a demo of a recreation of a game of the same name on Roblox, which was shut down for copyright. If hearing the word Roblox turns you away from this, so be it, but let me say this; THE UMBRELLA MEN Nasir leaned back on the railing and watched the cars and buses go past on lethargic wheels, slowing to a crawl as what was left of the day sunk low behind the squat tenement blocks of the Mong Kok district. His long nose and deep sunken eye sockets gave him the appearance of a predatory bird, and as he peered around him, people passing on the sidewalk gave him a wide radius berth. He was a tall, gangly young man of nineteen, dressed in an ill-fitt.

So I've been sitting on feedback from 0.6-0.7 that's been building up for a while for a number of reasons. Set aside some time to finally sift through, reflect on and organize it all which was a bit of an undertaking.
